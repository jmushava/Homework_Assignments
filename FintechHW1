# Robinhood- A Deep Dive into Investment Management and The World of FinTech

## Overview and Origin

Robinhood Markets, Inc. (Robinhood) is an American financial services company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Robinhood was founded in April 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. They first published the app on the AppStore in December 2014 and then it was officially launched in March 2015. 

According to their website, Vladimir and Baiju moved to New York City after graduating from Stanford University. While in New York City, they discovered that big Wall Street firms were paying next-to-nothing to trade stocks, while most Americans were charged commissions for every single trade. They wanted to change that, so they headed back to California to build a financial product that would give everyone—not just the wealthy—access to financial markets.

Prior to going public, Robinhood had raised a total of $5.6B in funding over 25 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Feb 1, 2021, from a Convertible Note round. On Jul 29, 2021, Robinhood went public under the ticker symbol HOOD at $38 a share. As of August 27, 2021, Robinhood is trading at $46.87 with a market cap of $40B.

## Business Activities

As mentioned before, Robinhood was formed with the intention to build a financial product that would give everyone—not just the wealthy—access to financial markets. The founders wanted to rectify the philosophy that existed whereby the more you had, the better deal you got. Instead, their mission is to give everyone access to the financial system, regardless of their background or bank account balance.

Robinhood’s intended customer is the average American who cannot afford high brokerage fees and may not be as knowledgeable about investing as the institutional investors that Robinhood’s competitors cater to. The founders have always said that they would rather serve many small customers over a few large ones. 

Some key Robinhood statistics:

•	Robinhood’s average user age is 31
•	Robinhood’s average account size is $3,500
•	As of July 2021, Robinhood has 18 million active users
 
Robinhood offers commission-free stock, ETF and options trades, and free cryptocurrency trading. They also have uniform interest rates and no-account minimums. They also give investors the ability to buy fractional shares. All these factors give Robinhood a competitive advantage because it means that anyone with any amount of money can invest. 

I became an investor on Robinhood during college and I think about how I couldn’t afford an Amazon stock or how I couldn’t afford commission fees or account minimums. Robinhood created a platform for students and/or young adults like myself to not be left out and that is what sets them apart. That may be an unfair advantage, but they saw a gap in the market and filled it. 

When it comes to technology, Robinhood uses a plethora of applications including but not limited to HTML5, Google Analytics, Python, GitHub, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company uses AWS to operate its online business, deliver and update its mobile trading app, securely store customer information and trading data, and perform business analytics.

## Landscape

When it comes to FinTech domains, Robinhood falls under investment management, private investment management specifically.

FinTech is changing the landscape of investment management. Advancements over the years include the use of Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to evaluate investment opportunities, optimize portfolios, and mitigate risks. Applications for investment management include text analytics and natural language processing, robo-advisory services, risk analysis, and algorithmic trading.

Major companies in the investment management domain include Square, E-Trade, PayPal, Coinbase, Ripple and SoFi. 

## Results

When it comes to Robinhood’s impact, even though the company has had its share of ups and downs, its impact cannot be ignored. Robinhood has successfully removed barriers to trading by making investing commission-free and mobile-first. It has simplified investing and made it more accessible and personal. Robinhood is a disruptor, and it exemplifies the way that technology can turn any industry with gatekeepers into a more open platform and force the established giants to innovate and expand. 

With any company, you have to look at its performance relative to other companies in its industry. When it comes to this domain, we can review the following:

1.	Acquisition Metrics- Robinhood has seen tremendous growth, they’ve gone from 0.5 million active users to 18 million and climbing in 6 years
2.	Activation Metrics- Robinhood’s platform is simple but meets investor needs
3.	Retention Metrics- Judging by the user growth, it seems new users are coming, liking what they see and staying
4.	Referrals- Robinhood offers a free stock for every referral which is enticing to potential investors
5.	Revenues- Robinhood’s revenue has grown from $2.9 million to $959 million in 5 years
6.	Marketing Metrics –It seems word of mouth is the best marketing tool for Robinhood
7.	Technical Metrics- Robinhood has had its fair share of technical issues, and this may be attributed to their emphasis on simplicity, but for users, you can navigate the trading platform very easily

Looking at these metrics, there is room for improvement, but I think Robinhood is growing and evolving and as an active user, I am optimistic about the future. 

Relative to competitors, I think Robinhood is holding its own considering that most of its competitors have been around longer. CNBC defined Robinhood as a disruptor and while it may not have as many users or as much revenue as its competitors, Robinhood has forced them to revisit systems that have been in place for a long time. That alone is success!

## Recommendations

Robinhood’s biggest issues have been customers complaining that there are holds placed on their funds and they can’t withdraw their money in a timely manner, especially for larger withdrawal amounts. Other issues have also been customer support and how it could be better. Customers have also reported outages and technical issues as well as a lack of thorough reporting on companies, market research and overall education. These are the main areas I see Robinhood needing to work on. 

My recommendation would be to provide more transparency with customers, if larger transactions take longer to process, let it be known and if you say it will take 7-10 business days, let it be that and not 20 days. This way, you build trust and confidence with your customers. Robinhood needs to evaluate what systems are in place and if necessary, replace or improve them because getting your money back should be just as easy as giving it. 

When it comes to customer service, along with security and ease of use, it is one of the most important fundamentals of any business. I think of my customer experience with Amazon, it’s one of the best experiences I’ve had and it’s what keeps me as a returning customer. Word of mouth is one of Robinhood’s biggest marketing tools and reviews of bad customer service is not the reputation you want to have if you wish to attract new customers or keep existing ones. 

For lack of information and education, I would suggest more being offered for free members rather than limiting it to paid Robinhood Gold members. Robinhood prides itself in being the trading platform for new and inexperienced investors so that should come with the necessary educational tools. Morningstar is a Gold member benefit, maybe Robinhood could partner with them on a lower level for free users.

With regards to outages and technical issues, this is an issue that almost every trading platform has faced at some point likely because the trade volume and/or traffic was underestimated. Unfortunately, this results in customers losing money: every investor’s trading nightmare. My suggestion going forward would be to over prepare and improve their software and hardware capacity, especially as individual investors are only increasing on the market. 

Overall Robinhood has achieved what it set out to do, democratizing finance for all. They have a lot more improving to do, but I’m optimistic that the downsides to the trading platform are just growing pains that will be overcome with time. Robinhood has just purchased Say in an attempt to improve shareholder-company relations. This is a step in the right direction and hopefully now that Robinhood has recently gone public, they will use the influx of capital to improve on the issues and concerns customers have posed.
